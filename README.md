# Cascadence

Cascadence aims to provide a flexible framework for orchestrating complex, multi-step tasks. The project is inspired by the Product Requirements Document (PRD), which outlines features such as:

- Graph-based task definitions for clear dependency management.
- Plugin architecture allowing custom processors and extensions.
- Configurable execution engine supporting synchronous and asynchronous flows.
- Built-in instrumentation and monitoring.

This repository lays the groundwork for the Python package implementation.
