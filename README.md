# Cascadence

Cascadence aims to provide a flexible framework for orchestrating complex, multi-step tasks. The project is inspired by the Product Requirements Document (PRD), which outlines features such as:

- Graph-based task definitions for clear dependency management.
- Plugin architecture allowing custom processors and extensions.
- Configurable execution engine supporting synchronous and asynchronous flows.
- Built-in instrumentation and monitoring.

This repository lays the groundwork for the Python package implementation.

## Temporal Integration

The :mod:`task_cascadence.temporal` module wraps the ``temporalio`` client.
Schedulers can use this backend to execute workflows remotely and replay
workflow histories for debugging purposes.

## Command Line Usage

After installing the package in an environment with ``typer`` available, the
``task`` command becomes available.  It exposes several sub-commands:

```bash
$ task list       # show all registered tasks
$ task run NAME   # execute a task
$ task disable NAME  # disable a task
```

The repository ships with a single ``example`` task to demonstrate the
mechanics.

The CLI's ``main`` function can also be called programmatically:

```python
from task_cascadence.cli import main

main([])  # run without command-line arguments
```

``main`` accepts an optional ``args`` list which defaults to ``[]`` and is
passed to the underlying Typer application.

## Schedule Persistence

``CronScheduler`` stores cron expressions in ``schedules.yml`` by default.  The
file is created next to the running application unless ``storage_path`` is
overridden.  It contains a simple YAML mapping of task class names to their
crontab schedules:

```yaml
ExampleTask: "0 12 * * *"
```

When a new ``CronScheduler`` instance starts it reads this file and re-creates
any jobs for which task objects are supplied via the ``tasks`` argument.  This
allows scheduled tasks to survive process restarts.


## Metrics

Use ``start_metrics_server`` to expose Prometheus metrics for tasks. Run it at application startup specifying a port:

```python
from task_cascadence.metrics import start_metrics_server

start_metrics_server(port=9000)
```

Metrics like ``task_latency_seconds`` and ``task_success_total`` will then be available from ``http://localhost:9000/metrics``.
